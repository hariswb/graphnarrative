# Network Narrative

This project is an experiment of reviewing Les Miserables novel by its social network with the help of interractive dashboard which could show some characters information and a number of measurements usually used in social network analysis. The dashboard user interface is designed in a way information about the network could come gradually to the user. Click is the major gesture to interract with the network. 

This project is build using react.js and d3.js. The layout of the network is readily available [here by Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-graph). The data are collected from various resources and processed using jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/hariswb/les-miserable-sna). Especially for the community detection, I use my python implementation of [genetic algorithm](https://github.com/hariswb/ga-community-detection). 

Enjoy The exploration. Have a good day!
